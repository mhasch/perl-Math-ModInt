Contributing to Math-ModInt
===========================

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this Perl 5
library.  Currently, it is in active development and maintained
by its original author.  Bug reports (with or without patch),
suggestions, feature requests, and comments are welcome.  You may
submit them through this distribution's bug tracker on CPAN RT:

Development Guidelines
----------------------

This library, dealing with a mathematical concept, should first and
foremost be scientifically sound.  Correctness is rated over all other
quality aspects.  The second most important goal is a documentation and
over-all presentation that makes it useful for experts and informative
for anybody interested in the field.  Thirdly, it should be easy to
integrate correctly and efficiently with other software.

Topics of interest
------------------

Possible improvements may address performance, perhaps by making
third-party math libraries available as backends, or functionality,
by adding missing operators like multiplicative order or logarithm,
or of course documentation.

Author's Note
-------------

Thanks again for your interest.
I am looking forward to your report or e-mail.
