ANNOUNCE: Math::ModInt 0.005

Math::ModInt version 0.005 should shortly become available from:

    http://search.cpan.org/~mhasch/Math-ModInt-0.005/

Math::ModInt is a Perl class providing modular integer arithmetic
with overloaded Perl operators.

Version 0.005 is a maintenance update addressing a dependency issue
(rt #63215) and slightly improving the documentation.

For details, see the Changes file in the distribution.

Note that there is a bug in Math::BigInt version 1.99 (rt #63237)
Math::ModInt still cannot cope with.  In order to use Math::ModInt,
a version of Math::BigInt other than 1.99 should be installed.

As usual, bug reports and suggestions are welcome -- please submit
them through the CPAN RT:
